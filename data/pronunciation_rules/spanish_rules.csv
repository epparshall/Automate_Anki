C & G (Hard vs. Soft),"'C' is hard [k] before a, o, u ('casa') but soft [s] or [θ] before e, i ('cena'). 'G' is hard [g] before a, o, u ('gato') but a soft, throaty [x] before e, i ('gente').",gato vs gente,[ˈɡa.to] vs [ˈxen.te],cat and people
B & V,"In most Spanish dialects, 'B' and 'V' are pronounced identically. At the start of a phrase they are a hard [b]. Between vowels, they are a soft, breathy [β].",beber,[be.ˈβeɾ],drinking glass
